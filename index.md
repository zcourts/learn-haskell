How it started?
===============

This repo is created to maintain some docs as I learn haskell. 
I read [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) and [Real world Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/). Both great books that I would recommend.
Actually technically I skimmed both books. The point is by the end of it all I could read and understand most Haskell source code I came across but when I was ready to write some custom stuff I came up blank... didn't know where or how to start.

So this repo is a simple site that includes a bunch of progressive exercises I've done which helped.

Unfortunately I didn't do this while I was stuck, the repo came after I could write some OK looking haskell so it may not be quite accurate in portraying exactly what I did, but it's as much as I remember.

Since I continue to learn new things about Haskell, I'll try to continue adding stuff.

See [haskell.zcourts.com](http://haskell.zcourts.com).

Why Haskell
===========

* Because I'm tired of imperitive languages and the burden they bring. I know Haskell too has it's kinks but they're easier to digest.

* The concepts and ideas you find in Haskell opens your mind to a raft of different things. 
* It performs well.
* It integrates amazingly with C and C++ (with some C wrapper or small modifications)
* It's interesting and sufficiently different to other languages to the point where it doesn't feel like a boring routine working with it.
* It chips away so much boiler plate code.
* It allows all sorts of expressiveness.
* Very modular, re-usable
* You can express otherwise impossible things(i.e. impossible in say Java)

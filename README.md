Learn Haskell
=============

This repo is created to maintain some docs as I learn haskell. 
I read [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) and [Real world Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/). Both great books that I would recommend.
Actually technically I skimmed both books. The point is by the end of it all I could read and understand most Haskell source code I came across but when I was ready to write some custom stuff I came up blank... didn't know where or how to start.

So this repo is a simple site that includes a bunch of progressive exercises I've done which helped.

Unfortunately I didn't do this while I was stuck, the repo came after I could write some OK looking haskell so it may not be quite accurate in portraying exactly what I did, but it's as much as I remember.

Since I continue to learn new things about Haskell, I'll try to continue adding stuff.

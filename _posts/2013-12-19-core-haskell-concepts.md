I suspect one of the reasons I had so much trouble learning Haskell was the amount of theory that is explained in the currently available resources. While interesting it is a lot to digest. Learning Haskell involves a massive paradigm shift. Throw that in with a huge amount of theory and new concepts you've probably never heard about just compounds the issue. Pretty much everything I can think of in Haskell has some deep rooted theory behind it. But it is not necessary to know or understand that theory to be practical in Haskell. And I think that's where some resources go wrong, they get so caught up in the fascinating theory that practical application of it is just glanced over. 


That's the more "scientific" approach I suppose. But I think programming in general is something that can be introduced the brute force way. Give an introduction, the absolute minimum that is necessary to get on with it and then the rest of the time is devoted to practicing. If it had to be a ratio I'd say it should be 1:9, i.e. spend 90% of the time practicing and the other 10% introducing the foundation needed to do the 90%... This section is about 8 of the 10%. It'll include a bunch of Haskell features, it need not all be understood right now but having an awareness of their existence will prove useful for the the things practiced later.

As the later examples are covered the features mentioned in this section will become more and more useful. Treat it as a reference for the examples to come. If an example isn't obvious or the explanation isn't good enough, flip back to this and try to make the connection.

# Functions

Perhaps not surprisingly functions are very important in Haskell, so being able to read, write and understand them is a fundamental skill you'll need in the Haskell world.


Haskell uses spaces to delimit tokens. In some other languages you might write a function definition like this (Java):

{% highlight java linenos %}
void f(int age, String name){
	System.out.println(name + " is "+age+" years old");
}

//use it like this
f(23,"Courtney");
//outputs
//Courtney is 23 years old
{% endhighlight %}

In Haskell you could write the same function like this:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
-- line below is optional but typically included by convention to help readability
f :: Int -> String -> IO ()  
f age name = print (name ++ " is " ++ show age ++ " years old")
--us it like this
f 23 "Courtney"
--outputs
--Courtney is 23 years old
{% endhighlight %}

* Types can be though of as a way to group things (data or functions). For example the type "Num" represents operations that apply to numbers in general, the type Int represents counting numbers i.e. 1,2,3... etc. A type allows us to group things that are similar.

* Identifiers e.g. function or variable names can optionally specify a type (Identifiers ALWAYS have a type in Haskell but if you don't specify one the compiler can normally infer the type for you). The identifier name preceeds it's type and is separated by ::, i.e. double colon. In the string "a :: Int" the identifier a is an integer.                                               

* In a function's declaration, each type is separated by a right arrow i.e. "->", such that the declaration "f :: Int -> String -> IO ()" can be read as; The function f accepts two parameters (not strictly true but can be interpreted as such), an Int and a string and returns an IO Unit (i.e. IO ()). 

* () is effectively saying nothing is returned. Tuples are explained later where this syntax will show up again.

* Things are immutable in Haskell by default. So if you say " let a = 1". The value of 1 is always going to be the result of using the identifier a.

* You declare a function by providing a series of equations that are to match the expected inputs to the function.


* A function's parameters are separated by a whitespace.

* The first identifer in a function's declaration is the function's name, all valid identifers after are parameters which the function accepts.

* Parameters to a function are followed by an equal sign after which the value of each parameter will be bound to each identifier and can then be used.


## Higher order functions

A higher order function is any function which accepts another function as it's parameter. In Haskell you tend to define what things are rather than the steps required to change the state of the world around you. Higher order functions make this a cinch.

## Pattern matching and Partial functions

A partial function is one that is not defined for all possible arugments of a given type. The following is a partial function, where we define a match for when the age is 12 but all other cases are undefined. These undefined cases makes it a partial function, while this will compile and run, if an age other than 12 is passed in then we'll get an error.

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
partial :: Int -> String -> IO ()  
partial 12 name = print ("Haha you're a child! " ++ name ++ " you're 12 years old")
{% endhighlight %}

Testing the function with valid (12) and invalid age demonstrates what happens

{% highlight bash linenos %}

*CoreConcepts> :load CoreConcepts.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling CoreConcepts     ( CoreConcepts.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: CoreConcepts.
*CoreConcepts> partial 12 "Courtney"
"Haha you're a child! Courtney you're 12 years old"
*CoreConcepts> partial 13 "Courtney"
*** Exception: CoreConcepts.hs:7:1-83: Non-exhaustive patterns in function partial
 /;./
{% endhighlight %}

When you specify a function it is important to ensure that all possible inputs are matched and where it is not possible to list all posibilities define the function the way "f" was defined or use a "catch-all". In order to make our function "exhaustive" in what it matches we could re-define it like this:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
total :: Int -> String -> IO ()  
total 12 name = print ("Haha you're a child! " ++ name ++ " you're 12 years old")
total _ name = print (name ++ " maybe you're a child, maybe you're not...but we'll just say you are :)")
{% endhighlight %}

Now our function can handle any age and it won't blow up. The underscore i.e. _ acts as a sort of "catch-all" and just says we don't care what age is if it's not 12, this bit of our function should be executed.

{% highlight bash linenos %}

*CoreConcepts> :load CoreConcepts.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling CoreConcepts     ( CoreConcepts.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: CoreConcepts.
*CoreConcepts> total 12 "Courtney"
"Haha you're a child! Courtney you're 12 years old"
*CoreConcepts> total 13 "Courtney"
"Courtney maybe you're a child, maybe you're not...but we'll just say you are :)"
*CoreConcepts> total 1 "Courtney"
"Courtney maybe you're a child, maybe you're not...but we'll just say you are :)"
*CoreConcepts>

{% endhighlight %}

What if we wanted to get access to the age? But didn't know or care what it was? Well, we did this earlier so we can re-define our function to be this:


{% highlight haskell linenos %}
total2 :: Int -> String -> IO ()  
total2 12 name = print ("Haha you're a child! " ++ name ++ " you're 12 years old")
total2 age name = print (name ++ " you're " ++ show age ++ " years old")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
*CoreConcepts> total2 12 "Courtney"
"Haha you're a child! Courtney you're 12 years old"
*CoreConcepts> total2 13 "Courtney"
"Courtney you're 13 years old"
*CoreConcepts> total2 23 "Courtney"
"Courtney you're 23 years old"
*CoreConcepts>
{% endhighlight %}

This section started out describing partial functions but in fact we've been doing at least two things here. Creating partial and total functions is one but the other thing we've been doing is known as pattern matching. So when we define the function called "partial" we said "when age is 12 execute this block of code". Then we defined "total" we were saying "when age is 12 perform this action but if age is anything else do this action".

By setting specific values such as 12 we're matching the input parameter which would cause the block of code after the equal sign to be executed.

## Gaurds

Guards are a way for us to check if a condition is true or false. Similar to the pattern matching we did previously. We can rewrite our total function to include some guards like this:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
gaurdedTotal :: Int -> String -> IO ()  
gaurdedTotal age name 
           | age <= 12 = print ("Haha you're " ++ show age ++ " you're a child, " ++ name)
           | age <= 35 = print ("You're " ++ show age ++ ", supposedly this is the best time of your life !")
           | age <= 55 = print ("Ohhh, " ++ name ++ " you're getting on a bit there at" ++ show age ++ " aren't you!")
           | otherwise = print ("To be honest " ++ name ++ " at "++ show age ++ " it's cruel to take a jab at you :P!")
{% endhighlight %}

See how similar it looks? The "otherwise" is equivalent to the underscore we used earlier to catch any case we didn't explicitly specify. In fact otherwise is pretty much just using "True" as the condition which will always succeed.

__Notice the order in which gaurds and patterns are given. The more specific patterns and gaurds are given first.__ 

Here's the output of trying it:

{% highlight bash %}
*CoreConcepts> :load CoreConcepts.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling CoreConcepts     ( CoreConcepts.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: CoreConcepts.
*CoreConcepts> gaurdedTotal 12 "Courtney"
"Haha you're 12 you're a child, Courtney"
*CoreConcepts> gaurdedTotal 35 "Courtney"
"You're 35, supposedly this is the best time of your life !"
*CoreConcepts> gaurdedTotal 50 "Courtney"
"Ohhh, Courtney you're getting on a bit there at50 aren't you!"
*CoreConcepts> gaurdedTotal 98 "Courtney"
"To be honest Courtney at 98 it's cruel to take a jab at you :P!"
*CoreConcepts>
{% endhighlight%}

## Where expressions

Patterns and gaurds define the conditions on which a block of code should be executed. But once we're in that block, what if we need to use a computed value that is shared accross all the function's code blocks? For example in the function

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
sum :: Int -> Int -> IO ()  
sum a b 
  | a + b == 2 = print ("Yup " ++ show a ++ "+" ++ show b ++ " = 2" )
  | a + b == 10 = print ("Yup " ++ show a ++ "+" ++ show b ++ " = 10 " )
  | otherwise = print "You're not very good at this math thing are you?" 
{% endhighlight %}

We're repeating a+b and if added more patterns we'd repeat it even more. This reptition can be replaced. Actually, it's not the repitition so much as putting the logic for the calculation in one place that matters. Imagine we made a mistake in one instance where we repeated a computation? To help this we can use the where keyword as in:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
sumWhere :: Int -> Int -> IO ()  
sumWhere a b 
  | combined == 2 = print ("Yup " ++ show a ++ "+" ++ show b ++ " = 2" )
  | combined == 10 = print ("Yup " ++ show a ++ "+" ++ show b ++ " = 10 " )
  | otherwise = print "You're not very good at this math thing are you?"  
   where combined = a + b
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
*CoreConcepts> :load CoreConcepts.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling CoreConcepts     ( CoreConcepts.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: CoreConcepts.
*CoreConcepts> mySum 1 1
"Yup 1+1 = 2"
*CoreConcepts> mySum 1 9
"Yup 1+9 = 10 "
*CoreConcepts> mySum 1 10
"You're not very good at this math thing are you?"
*CoreConcepts> sumWhere  1 10
"You're not very good at this math thing are you?"
*CoreConcepts> sumWhere  1 9
"Yup 1+9 = 10 "
*CoreConcepts> sumWhere  1 1
"Yup 1+1 = 2"
*CoreConcepts>
{% endhighlight %}

How awesome is that? This means you should never have a valid excuse for duplicating the code to perform the same computation.

## Let expressions

Let expressions do a similar thing to where. It allows you to bind an expression to an identifier. The major difference however is that a let expression is local to the code block in which it is bound. i.e. they are no accessible from multiple gaurds or patterns. You create them like so:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
sumLet :: Int -> Int -> IO ()  
sumLet a b =
        let total = a + b
        in  print ("The total is " ++ show total)
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the other difference? With let expressions the definitions come before the usage whereas the where keyword allows definitions to be used before they are defined in the source. Let expressions also go with the "in" key word. Multiple identifers can be bound between the "let" and "in" keywords. Those bindings are then available for use in the expressions that follow the "in" keyword. As in:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
sumLet2 :: Int -> Int -> IO ()  
sumLet2 a b =
        let total = a + b
            times = a * b
        in  print ("The total is " ++ show total ++ " and times each other the value is " ++ show times)        
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
*CoreConcepts> :load CoreConcepts.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling CoreConcepts     ( CoreConcepts.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: CoreConcepts.
*CoreConcepts> sumLet2 1 1
"The total is 2 and times each other the value is 1"
*CoreConcepts> sumLet2 2 2
"The total is 4 and times each other the value is 4"
*CoreConcepts> sumLet2 2 3
"The total is 5 and times each other the value is 6"

{% endhighlight %}

## Case expressions

Case expressions are effectively the same as pattern matching. Take a look:

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
caseExpr :: [Int] -> IO ()
caseExpr xs = case xs of [] -> print "Yeah, we don't like empty lists"
                         x:xss -> print x
{% endhighlight %}

In fact pattern matching is just a slightly better looking way of doing case expressions...

This function also introduces something else that we'll get to when we cover data structures later. But for now just go with [] being a list...it is, really.

So in our "caseExpr" function we've used case identifier of pattern1 -> code pattern2 -> code2
